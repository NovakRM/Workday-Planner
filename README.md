# Workday-Planner

* A cool little web application that allows users to input text for a 9-5 work day and stores them locally. 

* Divs update based on parameters of past (white) / present (yellow) / future (teal) so you can keep track of what is and is not current. 

* Currently can be cleared by accessing local storage under application, right click + select "clear." You can also just save over items.
